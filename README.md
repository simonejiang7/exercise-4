# Exercise 4: Operating on Linked Data 

This repository contains a partial implementation of a [JaCaMo](https://github.com/jacamo-lang/jacamo) application, in which autonomous agents are able to operate on Linked Data in a distributed social network — and to manage personal data of a user.

## Task 2 
### Edit the Access Control List of your Solid pod
- Use [PodPro](https://podpro.dev/) to navigate and edit the Access Control List (ACL) of your Solid pod (https://solid.interactions.ics.unisg.ch/your-pod-name/.acl). Update the `<#public>` authorization rule based on the [Web Access Control vocabulary](https://solid.github.io/web-access-control-spec/#authorization-rule) so that agents can interact with your pod to read and/or write data:
```
@prefix acl: <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#>.
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>.

<#public>
    a acl:Authorization;
    acl:agentClass foaf:Agent;
    acl:accessTo <./>;
    acl:mode acl:Read, acl:Write, acl:Control;
    acl:default <./>.
```

### Interact with a Linked Data Platform Container
First, update line 24 in the JaCaMo configuration file [task.jcm](task.jcm), so that the project uses your own Solid pod:
```
artifact pod: solid.Pod("https://solid.interactions.ics.unisg.ch/your-pod-name")
```

Second, complete the tasks that follow to enable autonomous agents to interact with [our group's Solid Community Server](https://solid.interactions.ics.unisg.ch/) that implements the [Solid protocol](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol), based on the [W3C Linked Data Platform (LDP) specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/). The API of our group’s Solid Community Server is [documented here](https://communitysolidserver.github.io/CommunitySolidServer/5.x/).

With the completion of the tasks you should expect the following project behavior: The personal assistant ([personal_assistant.asl](src/agt/personal_assistant.asl)) creates an LDP container in your pod, named "personal-data", and informs the other agents that a new container is available. As a result, the movie manager ([movie_manager.asl](src/agt/movie_manager.asl)) stores in the container the titles of movies you add to your watchlist (e.g. Matrix, Inseption etc.) within a file watchlist.txt. The wristband manager ([wristband_manager.asl](src/agt/wristband_manager.asl)) stores in the container information about the number of hours you sleep every night (e.g. 6h, 7h, 5h etc. every 4000ms) within a file sleep.txt. Additionally, the wristband manager stores in the container information about the distance of the running trails that you follow every time you train (e.g. 3km, 5.5km, 5.5km etc. every 4000s) within a file trails.txt. Every 10000ms, the personal assistant reads the data available in the "personal-data" container to make movie or running trail suggestions based on the number of hours you slept last night. 

#### 1. Creating an LDP container
Implement the method `createContainer()` of the Java class [`Pod`](src/env/solid/Pod.java) that enables agents to to create an LDP container in your pod.
- TIP: [Creating containers based on the Linked Data Platform 1.0 documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-primer/#creating-containers-and-structural-hierarchy)

#### 2. Adding data to an LDP container
Implement the method `publishData()` of the Java class [`Pod`](src/env/solid/Pod.java) that enables agents to publish data (text/plain) to an LDP container in your pod.
- TIP: [Creating resources (e.g. publishing data to a container) based on the Solid Community Server documentation](https://communitysolidserver.github.io/CommunitySolidServer/5.x/usage/example-requests/#put-creating-resources-for-a-given-url)

#### 3. Reading data from an LDP container
Implement the method `readData()` of the Java class [`Pod`](src/env/solid/Pod.java) that enables agents to read data (text/plain) from an LDP container in your pod.
- TIP: [Retrieving resources (e.g. reading data from a container) based on the Solid Community Server documentation](https://communitysolidserver.github.io/CommunitySolidServer/5.x/usage/example-requests/#get-retrieving-resources)
